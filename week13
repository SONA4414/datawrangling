EXPERIMENT 13
AIM: Creating dashboards and storytelling, design for different displays, adding interactivity
Step 1 − Create a blank worksheet by using the add worksheet icon located at the bottom of the
workbook.
Drag the dimension Segment to the columns shelf and the dimension Sub-Category to the Rows Shelf. 
Drag and drop the measure Sales to the Color shelf and the measure Profit to the Size shelf.
This worksheet is referred as the Master worksheet. Right-click and rename this worksheet as Sales_Profits. 

Step 2 − Create another sheet to hold the details of the Sales across the States. For this, drag the dimension
State to the Rows shelf and the measure Sales to the Columns shelf as shown in the following screenshot. Next, apply a filter to the State field to arrange the Sales in a descending order.
Right-click and rename this worksheet as Sales_state.

Step 3 − Next, create a blank dashboard by clicking the Create New Dashboard link at the bottom of
the workbook.
Right-click and rename the dashboard as Profit_Dashboard.

Step 4 − Drag the two worksheets to the dashboard. Near the top border line of Sales Profit worksheet,
you can see three small icons. Click the middle one, which shows the prompt Use as Filter on hovering the mouse over it.

Step 5 − Now in the dashboard, click the box representing Sub-Category named Machines and segment named Consumer.
You can notice that only the states where the sales happened for this amount of profit are filtered out in the right pane named Sales_state. This illustrates how the sheets are linked in a dashboard.
